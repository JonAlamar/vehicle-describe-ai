## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

### Frontend (Static Website)
- **Technology**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hosting**: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN
- **Features**: Clean, responsive interface with real-time API integration

### Backend (Serverless API)
- **Technology**: AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)
- **API**: AWS API Gateway with CORS support
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o API
- **Data Source**: S3-hosted CSV inventory feeds
- **Security**: AWS Secrets Manager for API key storage

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: AWS CloudFormation templates
- **Security**: IAM roles with minimal required permissions, API keys stored in Secrets Manager
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logging for debugging and analytics

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- An S3 bucket containing your vehicle inventory CSV file
- OpenAI API key stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- OpenAI API access

### Required CSV Format

Your inventory CSV should include these columns:
- `stock_number`: Unique vehicle identifier
- `year`: Vehicle year
- `make`: Vehicle manufacturer
- `model`: Vehicle model
- `Trim`: Vehicle trim level (optional)
- `drivetrain`: Drive system (FWD, RWD, AWD, 4WD)
- `mileage.value`: Current mileage
- `transmission`: Transmission type

### Setup

1. **Store OpenAI API Key in Secrets Manager**:
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
     --name "vehicle-generator/openai-api-key" \
     --secret-string "your-openai-api-key"
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name vehicle-description-backend \
     --template-body file://vehicle-description-backend.yaml \
     --parameters ParameterKey=VehicleFeedBucketName,ParameterValue=your-bucket-name \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
   ```

3. **Package and Upload Lambda Code**:
   ```bash
   pip install openai -t .
   zip -r lambda.zip . -x "*.yaml" "*.md" "*.html" "*.css" "*.js" "*.png"
   aws s3 cp lambda.zip s3://your-bucket-name/
   ```

4. **Deploy Frontend Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name vehicle-description-frontend \
     --template-body file://vehicle-description-frontend.yaml \
     --parameters ParameterKey=FrontendBucketName,ParameterValue=your-frontend-bucket
   ```

5. **Upload Frontend Files**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync . s3://your-frontend-bucket --exclude "*.yaml" --exclude "*.py" --exclude "*.zip"
   ```

6. **Update API Endpoint**: Edit your frontend HTML to use the API Gateway URL from the CloudFormation output.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (Lambda)
- `BUCKET_NAME`: S3 bucket containing inventory CSV
- `CSV_KEY`: Path to CSV file in S3 bucket (e.g., "MP8035.csv")
- `OPENAI_SECRET_NAME`: AWS Secrets Manager secret name (defaults to "vehicle-generator/openai-api-key")

### OpenAI Configuration
- **Model**: GPT-4o for high-quality, engaging descriptions
- **Temperature**: 0.3 for consistent, professional output
- **Max Tokens**: 300 for concise descriptions

### CSV Processing Features
- **Carfax Integration**: Supports "Clean Carfax" and "Carfax 1-Owner" prefixes
- **Smart Drivetrain**: Only mentions AWD/4WD drivetrains in descriptions
- **Flexible Trim Handling**: Gracefully handles missing trim information

## üéØ Usage

1. **Enter Stock Number**: Input the vehicle's stock number in the search field
2. **Lookup Vehicle**: Click "Lookup Vehicle" to retrieve vehicle details from inventory
3. **Add Options**: Enter key features and options (comma-separated)
4. **Select Carfax Options**: Check appropriate boxes for Clean Carfax or Carfax 1-Owner
5. **Generate Description**: Click "Generate Description" to create AI-powered copy
6. **Copy & Use**: Copy the generated description for use in your inventory platform

### Example Options Input
```
leather seats, sunroof, heated seats, backup camera
```

### Example Generated Output

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Testing
The Lambda function can be tested locally with sample events:

```python
# Test lookup endpoint
event = {
    "path": "/lookup",
    "queryStringParameters": {"stock": "19087"}
}

# Test generate endpoint  
event = {
    "path": "/generate",
    "queryStringParameters": {
        "stock": "19087",
        "options": "leather seats, sunroof",
        "cleanCarfax": "true",
        "carfax1Owner": "false"
    }
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /lookup?stock={stock_number}`: Retrieve vehicle details
- `GET /generate?stock={stock_number}&options={options}&cleanCarfax={boolean}&carfax1Owner={boolean}`: Generate description

## üìä Monitoring

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Automatic logging for debugging and monitoring
- **API Gateway Metrics**: Built-in request/response monitoring
- **Lambda Metrics**: Performance and error tracking
- **OpenAI API Usage**: Monitor token consumption and costs

## üîê Security

- **CORS Enabled**: Secure cross-origin requests
- **IAM Permissions**: Minimal required permissions for each service
- **Secrets Manager**: OpenAI API key securely stored and retrieved
- **HTTPS Only**: CloudFront enforces secure connections
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data managed through AWS services

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Vehicle Not Found**: Ensure stock number exists in CSV and matches exactly

**API Error**: Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages

**CSV Format Issues**: Verify all required columns are present with correct names

**OpenAI API Issues**: 
- Verify API key is correctly stored in Secrets Manager
- Check OpenAI API usage limits and billing
- Review CloudWatch logs for specific error messages

**Secrets Manager Access**: Ensure Lambda execution role has proper permissions to access the secret
